## 📙 The Study

> The Newsletter API was developed for the [**Newsletter project**](https://github.com/vinicioscst/newsletter-vue) to enhance knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and to learn new technologies such as **Vue** and **Gemini**, Google's artificial intelligence. Additionally, it served as a starting point for other concepts such as OOP and Design Patterns, specifically the Singleton design pattern, which is used in the instances of the ORM and the Cron tool.

## 💻 Technologies

- **Language** - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Framework** - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Runtime** [^1] - [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Database** [^2] - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **ORM** - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

> [^1]: If you do not want to use **Bun**, simply install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 or higher and remove the `bun.lockb` file.
> [^2]: If you do not want to use **Supabase**, simply install [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) and configure your database.

## 💡 The use of Artificial Intelligence

One of the key features of the API is the **use of artificial intelligence**, specifically the Gemini Flash 1.5 in its free version.
AI is used for data formatting and information generation based on the data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the project

git clone https://github.com/vinicioscst/newsletter-api.git

# Install dependencies

bun install or npm install

# Create the .env file and fill in the correct data

API_KEY=            # Insert your Gemini API key here
DATABASE_URL=       # Your database connection string. Example: postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
PORT=               # Port where the application will run
SECRET_KEY=         # Secret key for generating the user token upon login
SECRET_KEY_CRON=    # Secret key for configuring the Cron library
EXPIRES_IN=         # Token expiration time. Example: 1h

# Configure your database

bunx prisma db push ou npx prisma db push

# Run the application

bun run dev or npm run dev
```

## Endpoints

To check all the endpoints, request bodies, and responses, [**click here**](https://newsletter-api-fdpw.onrender.com/api/docs/#/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Certain routes require authentication (those with a lock icon). To access them, create a user (you won't be able to create another until the current one is deactivated), log in, and get the token from the response.
>
> To make user creation easier, you can use tools like [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/) or [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/)
